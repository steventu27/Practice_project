Financial engineering is the application of mathematical methods to the solution of problems in finance. (Equivalent names sometimes used are financial mathematics, mathematical finance, and computational finance.) It draws on tools from applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, and economic theory. Investment banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, corporate treasuries, and regulatory agencies apply the methods of financial mathematics to such problems as derivative securities valuation, portfolio structuring, risk management, and scenario simulation.

In order to learn better and find a quant job in future, I write a spider to extract relevant classes. With this table, quant-minding students could find favored course no matter major or audit them.

Hoping everyone can get a good job after graduation.
